* get timer by link (non human readable is enough)
* add new timer
    * generate id by client
* timers list (could grow looooong)
* get timer by name
* cors
* ssl (mixed content)
* once added timer cannot be modified
* each name belongs to someone (cookie based)
* sign in / sign up in order to be able to clear cookies and still be yourself
* group users to teams
* non-public timer (for team-members only)

should start_time be posted or inserted server-side?
